# Hashes 
<img src={fingerprint} style={{height:'64px'}} />

**"Digital Fingerprint"**

Any function that maps arbitrarily large data to a fixed size (usually 128/256/512 bits)

Good functions are **uniformly distributed** and have **few collisions** (two items that map to the same value)

Common algorithms: SHA-2, SHA-3, KECCAK

--- 
# Symmetric Keys 
## 🔑

Use a **key** is just arbitrary data that is kept secret (usually 128/256 bits)

Use a key to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a piece of data
- `text + key = cipher`
- `cipher + key = text`

<small>(Plus some <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/security-best-practices-symmetric-encryption-with-aes-in-java-7616beaaade9">extra complexity around initilization vectors</a>)</small>

Common algorithms: **AES**, Salsa20, TripleSec

# Asymmetric keypairs 
## 🔑🗝

### Private Key
- Must be kept **very secure**

### Public Key
- Derived from the private key
- Shared widely

---
# Asymmetric keypairs 
## 🔑🗝

### Digital Signatures
- Attached to a msg to prove that it was **created by the owner** of a private key and it **hasn't been altered**
- Can only be **created** if you know a given **private key** & the **hash of some data**
- Can be **verified** with the **public key** & the **hash of the data** 

### Key Exchange
- Exchange a symmetric key between two keypairs
- Leaks no information about the key or either keypair to the outside world

---
# Asymmetric keypairs 
## 🔑🗝

### RSA
- One of the first asymmetric cryptosystems
- Still widely used
- Based on **prime-factorization** of very large numbers
- Secure keys are **2048-4096 bits**

### ECC
- Relatively new cryptosystem
- Based on **point addition** on an elliptic curve
- Secure keys are **256 bits**

# WebCrypto 🔐
Browser API for creating keys & using cryptographic functions

Offers **SHA**, **AES**, **RSA**, and **ECC** (only NIST curves)

Supported by all **modern browsers**

--- 
import KeyStore from './Keystore'

# WebCrypto 💜 IndexedDB

https://github.com/fission-suite/keystore-idb

<KeyStore />


---
import Webauthn from './Webauthn'

## WebAuthn 🕵

**Cryptographic authentication** in the browser

Creates a **U2F token** which is used by things like Yubikey and biometrics (fingerprints, etc)

Only for **authentication** not authorization, signing arbitrary data, or key exchange

**"Challenge"-based flow**

<Webauthn />

# Macaroons 🍪

Similar to Bearer tokens like JWTs

A **set of permissions** with a **signature** from a trusted authority

But a token-holder can sign an additional token with some **subset of their permissions**

When proving auth, you pass the **entire chain of tokens**

**Hence, Macaroons or "Stacked Cookies"** 😜

# Putting it all together

You have a **root key** with **full permissions** for your file system

You can **delegate any subset** of those permissions (including all of them!) to other keys

**Read** permissions through **key exchange**

**Write** permissions through **signed macaroons**

No need for access control lists!
